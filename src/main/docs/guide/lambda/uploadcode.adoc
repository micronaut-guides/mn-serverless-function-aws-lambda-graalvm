Micronaut's eases the deployment of your functions as a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html[Custom AWS Lambda runtime].

The main API you will interact with is https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/runtime/AbstractMicronautLambdaRuntime.html[AbstractMicronautLambdaRuntime]. An abstract class which you can extend to create your custom runtime `mainClass`. That class includes the necessary code to perform the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-custom.html#runtimes-custom-build[Processing Tasks] described in the Custom Runtime documentation.

The generated project contains such a class:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/example/micronaut/BookLambdaRuntime.java
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/java/example/micronaut/BookLambdaRuntime.java[]
----

== bootstrap

We deploy our custom runtime code as a ZIP file. At the root of the ZIP file you need a `bootstrap` file.

> If thereâ€™s a file named bootstrap in your deployment package, Lambda executes that file.

The generated application contains a `bootstrap` bash script:

[source,bash]
.bootstrap
----
include::{sourceDir}/bootstrap[]
----

== native-image.properties

To generate a GraalVM Native image of the application, we need a https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Configuration/#properties-file-format[native-image.properties] file.

[source,bash]
.src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/example.micronaut/complete-application/native-image.properties
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/example.micronaut/complete-application/native-image.properties[]
----

- The `H:Class` argument defines the main class of your app.
- The `H:Name` argument defines  the native image name. The Dockerfile references this name.

== Dockerfile

The project includes a Dockerfile to generate a GraalVM Native image.

- Uses the amazonlinux image
- Builds the JAR of the function.
- Install the necessary dependencies.
- Downloads GraalVM community edition
- Installs native-image utility.
- With the native-image command and the JAR, generates a GraalVM native image
- Bundles the native image of our function and the bootstrap file into a ZIP file.

[source,docker]
.Dockerfile
----
include::{sourceDir}/Dockerfile[]
----

The above file references the name used in the `native-image.properties` file.

== deploy.sh

It includes a bash script to generate the ZIP file:

[source,bash]
.deploy.sh
----
include::{sourceDir}/deploy.sh[]
----

== Upload the file

Execute `./deploy.sh` and once you have a ZIP file, upload it
