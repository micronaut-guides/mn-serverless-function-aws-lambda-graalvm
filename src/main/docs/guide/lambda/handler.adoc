The handler used is the one created at https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/api/io/micronaut/function/aws/runtime/MicronautLambdaRuntime.html[MicronautLambdaRuntime].

Thus, you don't need specify the handler in the AWS Lambda console.

However, I like to specify it in the console as well:

`example.micronaut.BookRequestHandler`

That value is exposed as an environment variable.
