Please, read about https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/index.html#lambda[Micronaut AWS Lambda Support] to learn more about different Lambda runtime, Triggers and Handlers and how to integrate with a Micronaut application.

The biggest problem with Java applications and Lambda is how to mitigate Cold startups. Executing GraalVM Native images of a Micronaut function in a Lambda Custom runtime is a solution to this problem.

If you want to respond to triggers such as queue events, s3 events or single endpoints you should opt to code your Micronaut functions as Serverless functions.

In this guide, we are going to deploy a Micronaut function as a GraalVM Native image to a AWS Lambda custom runtime.
